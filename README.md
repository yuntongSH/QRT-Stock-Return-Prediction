# QRT Stock Return Prediction

## Introduction

The QRT Stock Return Prediction project aims to predict stock returns based on historical data and various engineered features. This project utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a Neural Network, to create an ensemble model that enhances prediction accuracy.

## Objectives

- Load and preprocess stock return data.
- Engineer features that capture important trends and patterns in the data.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Implement an ensemble method to combine predictions from different models for improved accuracy.

## Files

- **Benchmark QRT.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for the project, including data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and ensemble methods.
