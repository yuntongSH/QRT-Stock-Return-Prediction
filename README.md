# QRT Stock Return Prediction

## Introduction

This project is part of our student initiative to tackle the **Qube Research & Technologies (QRT)** stock return prediction challenge. The task is to predict the **sign of residual returns** (returns stripped of market-wide effects) of U.S. equities using 20 business days of historical data. With over **600,000 samples**, this challenge is representative of real-world quantitative finance problems where the **signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low**.

We approach this challenge through an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling with multiple algorithms, and ensemble learning for final prediction.

## Dataset Description

- **Training Set**: 418,595 samples
- **Test Set**: 198,429 samples
- **Features**:
  - 20-day historical residual returns: `RET_1` to `RET_20`
  - 20-day relative volumes: `VOLUME_1` to `VOLUME_20`
  - Categorical: `STOCK`, `SECTOR`, `INDUSTRY`, `INDUSTRY_GROUP`, `SUB_INDUSTRY`
  - Target: `RET` (binary, top 50% residual return â†’ 1)

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. Data Cleaning

- **Missing Returns**: Rows with any missing values across the full 20-day window (`RET_1` to `RET_20`) were removed from both datasets to ensure complete return history. This resulted in the removal of **6,126 rows from the training set (1.46%)** and **4,494 rows from the test set (2.26%)**.
- **Missing Volumes**: Missing values in `VOLUME_1` to `VOLUME_20` were imputed using the **mean value of the same `INDUSTRY_GROUP` and `DATE`**. This preserves contextual consistency while reducing imputation bias.
- **Categorical Consistency**: Categorical identifiers such as `STOCK`, `SECTOR`, `INDUSTRY`, and `INDUSTRY_GROUP` were preserved and checked to ensure alignment between training and test sets, avoiding category leakage or mismatches during encoding.

### 2. Feature Engineering

We engineered advanced features to enrich the signal:

- **Moving Averages (MA)**: 5-day and 10-day rolling averages over return windows.
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**: Smoothed features with decayed emphasis on recent days.
- **MACD**: Difference between short-term and long-term EMAs, capturing momentum shifts.
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of 20-day return history.
- **Group-Based Aggregations**: Mean returns per `SECTOR` and `INDUSTRY_GROUP` per date.

All features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniform input to machine learning models.

### 3. Feature Selection

Selected features include:
- Historical: `RET_1` to `RET_5`, `VOLUME_1` to `VOLUME_5`
- Engineered: `VOLATILITY`, `RET_MA*`, `RET_EMA*`, `RET_MACD*`, `RET_IN_SECTOR*`
- Total number of features used: *varies based on data quality*

## Models and Evaluation

We trained and validated four models using time-based cross-validation (KFold on `DATE`):

- **Random Forest**: 500 trees, max depth 10
- **XGBoost**: 100 trees, depth 4, learning rate 0.05
- **CatBoost**: 200 iterations, depth 4
- **Neural Network**: 4-layer MLP with dropout and batch normalization

Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**
- **ROC AUC**
- **Classification Report**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Ensemble Performance

A uniform weighted ensemble was created:

- **Weights**: 0.25 for each of Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Neural Network
- **Decision Rule**: Median thresholding per date

**Final Training Accuracy**: `56.92%`  
**Final ROC AUC**: `0.6020`

**Classification Report:**

## Final Submission

- Test predictions were generated using the final ensemble model.
- A threshold per date was applied to assign class labels.
- Output was saved in submission format as: `qrt_output_stock_return_prediction.csv`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete development of a multi-model machine learning system for noisy financial time-series classification. Through structured preprocessing, targeted feature engineering, and robust ensembling, we surpassed the baseline benchmark (51.31% accuracy) with a final model achieving nearly 57% accuracy and over 60% ROC AUC.
