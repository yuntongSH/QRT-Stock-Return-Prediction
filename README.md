# QRT Stock Return Prediction

## Introduction
The QRT Stock Return Prediction project is a machine learning challenge focused on predicting the sign of residual stock returns in the U.S. equity market using 20 days of historical data. Residual returns are computed after removing market-wide effects, making the problem highly relevant to real-world quantitative investment strategies where signal-to-noise ratios are low.

Our team implemented and evaluated several classification modelsâ€”including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a Neural Networkâ€”and combined them using a weighted ensemble to improve predictive performance.

## Objectives
- Load and preprocess historical stock data.
- Engineer informative features using time-series and group-based techniques.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Implement an ensemble model for improved robustness and accuracy.
- Analyze performance using accuracy, AUC, and classification metrics.

## Files
- `Benchmark QRT.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and ensemble learning.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QRT-Stock-Return-Prediction.git
cd QRT-Stock-Return-Prediction
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost catboost tensorflow seaborn matplotlib
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

## Model Performance

After full training and validation, the ensemble model (combining Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Neural Network with equal weights) achieved the following performance on the training set:

- **Ensemble Accuracy**: 56.92%
- **Ensemble ROC AUC**: 0.6020
